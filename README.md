# Polybreakout Game
This repo is about an original game similar to breakout but the ball is not thrown back by a paddle but the walls of a turning polygon. The user controls the rotation of the polygon to impose the best angle that makes the balls go towards the bricks. 

The goal is to breal the breaks as quickest as possible.

Good Luck !

Here is a demo:
