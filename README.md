# Polybreakout Game
This project provides you with an original game similar to breakout but the ball is not thrown back by a paddle but the walls of a turning polygon. The user controls the rotation of the polygon to impose the best angle that makes the balls go towards the bricks. 

The goal is to break the bricks as quickest as possible.

With Polybreakout, a new polygon with a random shape is generated at every new level. With HexaBreakout, a constant polygon (Hexagon) is used during all the game.

## How to play
All you have to do is to download the HTML file "polybreakout-game.html" or "hexa-breakout-game.html" and open it using any browser (ex: Firefox, Chrome, Edge...).

Good Luck !
